# Poker hand evaluator, in Scala

This repository contains a Scala implementation of the same task that was given to qualify for the Evolution Gaming bootcamp originally. This implementation was made as part of the bootcamp with most of it being done by the lecturer, with part of the `Value.scala` left as a homework exercise.
In addition to the Texas Hold'em version that I solved in my Java solution, this version also handles the Omaha with no input flag needed (ranks Hold'em or Omaha hands depending what kind of hands are there in the input).

Task description: https://github.com/gatisnolv/poker-hands-scala/blob/main/Scala%20Bootcamp_Home%20task.pdf

My original solution of the task, in Java:

`sbt run`
